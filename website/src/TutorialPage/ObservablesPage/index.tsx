          <h1>Observables</h1>
          <p>An observable is an object which holds a value. Observers can subscribe to an observable to get notified when its value changes, and react accordingly â€” such as by updating the DOM. When using Elastic.js' JSX/TSX notation, observables written within curly brackets ({"{}"}) are automatically subscribed to in order to update the DOM.</p>

          <p>
            A particularly useful concept within the observable realm is the <em>computed observable</em> which value is the result of evaluating an expression which in turn depends on other observables.
            By changing the underlying observables within a computed observable's expression, the computed observable will re-evaluate itself and notify its subscribers if its value turns out to have changed.
          </p>
          <p>Elastic.js provides two types of observables: <code>ModifiableObservable&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>ComputedObservable&lt;T&gt;</code>, both of which implement the <code>Observable&lt;T&gt;</code> interface:</p>
          <MonacoEditor model={observableModel} readOnly showPath={true} />
          <p>
            The inline documentation for the <code>Observable&lt;T&gt;</code> interface is quite shallow.
            To better understand the <code>value</code> property and the various functions, the following sections attempts to explain their usage by exemplification.

          <p>Study the example below to get an impression of how observables and subscriptions are managed. If you run the example, you must open the developer tools (F12) in the newly opened window to observe the console output.</p>
          <MonacoEditor model={example1Model} />
          <h2 id="computed-observables">Computed observables</h2>
          <p>Computed observables are read-only. You may however, manipulate their values by manipulating the values of their underlying observables.</p>

          <p>Although disposing subscriptions (<code>ObservableSubscription&lt;T&gt;</code>) in order to unsubscribe from an observable is useful, the usefulness for disposing observables themselves seems less clear (particularly if they are never to be used again). However, there is a good reason for this pattern.</p>
